   • The purpose of this project is to teach us how to independently create programs in Java. 

   • This program contains java class files for sorting user input and the Main class.
   
   • You can by cloning the program and run with Intellj or flow the struction blow. 
    
   • By downloading the two Main.java and Sorter.java files, you could run the program on your any machine, Windows/Linux/Mac without any problems. Just make sure       you have the JDK installed on your machine Ex of running the program:
    
        ◦ $ javac Main.java // Compiling the java file.
        ◦ $ java Main 76 11 -55 2 16 -21 7 88 // Run the program with some input arguments
        ◦ Output should be like this  => -55 -21 2 7 11 16 76 88
